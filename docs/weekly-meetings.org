Agenda:
 - review past week's progess

Participants: GN, Karthik, R2, Survesh, VK
- Karthik:
  - Trial balance
  - Updates to profit / loss, cash reports views
  - Hide demo company details in production mode  
- Survesh:
  - UI updates in budget page (remove card view, add table row collapse)
  - Added search filters in Accounts page
  - CSS overrides to display hidden styles in print view

Points Discussed:
- Comments on print pages format,
  - When printing a table,
    - Make the table borders prominent.
    - Must check if its feasible to provide landscape printing options,
      when there are many columns.
  - When taking multi page printouts,
    - Page numbers are required. (e.g. 1 out of 2 pages)
    - If a table is printed across many pages, the table heading 
      must be carried forward in the overflowing pages.
    - Also if there is a page heading, it should also carry forward
      across all the pages.
    - To implement these features, we can look at a server side solution 
      using Libre Office Headless for print.
    - Or we can try to use the print library used by ERP Next.
- Comments on Accounts page,
  - Hide the cards that do not satisfy the search query. 
  - When a sub group or account is selected, hide the group or sub group 
    containing it and only display the item that was searched for.
  - When a sub group is queried, show the list of accounts in it without 
    a scroll bar.
- The side menu items should be grouped under collapsable headings.
  - Possible headings are Transaction, Admin, Journal, Report and Others.
  - Example: https://akaunting.com/public/images/pages/accounting-online-v2.png
- Updates in Transaction Profile page,
  - Add Links from the Invoice and Cash Memo profiles to their corresponding
    ledger pages.
  - In mobile view the vertical bill item table takes up a lot of vertical space, 
    this should be reduced.
- In Trial Balance page, the help text shown could be split into three parts and 
  shown separately for the 3 types of trial balances.
- Discussions on Bank Reconciliation statement,
  - Bank Reconciliation statement is one that helps in checking the discrepancies (if any)
    between the transaction accounts maintained by the company and that of the actual bank account.
  - Many commercial accounting softwares use a paid API like PLAID, to fetch details from the 
    user's bank account and perform reconciliation.
  - The process of updating the actual bank details in the accounting software can be done
    manually as well.
  - Example: https://app.qbo.intuit.com/app/reconcile?accountId=35 and 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezAtbPt7g4&feature=emb_title

Conclusion:
- Updates will be performed based on the points discussed above.

Points Discussed:
- Discussions on the ability of windows installer to work on low
config machines,
  - Need for minimum hardware requirements and benchmarks is there.
  - Since GNUKhata is dependent on python 3, we can say that any hardware + OS 
    combo that supports python 3 can run GNUKhata on it.

    for this)
- Dicussions on the application packaging tools for linux based OS,
  - Appimage and flatpak do not seem to be good choices for server based applications.
  - Snap seems to be a good fit here and has 32 bit support as well.
  - Debian packages are also widely supported and easy to work with.
  - We can choose either Snap or Deb, based on ease of maintaining and support across platforms.
- Updates to the current website (gnukhata.in),
  - Certain elements available in the current front page of gnukhata.in have been added after 
    due consideration, and those elements need to be translated to match with the new UI updates.
- Comments on the Budget page updates,
  - The card view UI can be omitted, as the table view is good.
  - Make the table rows collapsable.
- Comments on Accounts page,
  - Need search and filter options to query the list of accounts.
  - Show the list of transactions related to the accounts when clicking on them.

  - Try to incorporate Categorywise Stock on Hand to Stock on Hand page by 
    adding category as a filter, so that all Stock on Hand data is viewable

  - Added Budget List

Points Discussed:
  - Comments on Budget List Page,
    - The current table view in mobile, could be replaced with card view.
      so that it matches the accounts page UI.
    - Provide an option to switch between table UI and card based UI 
      so the UI choice is left to the user.
    - In table view, some columns are hidden and require scrolling. Indicate
      the page is scrollable with a swiping hand icon.
    - Check https://qbo.intuit.com/redir/testdrive, for inspiration on how budget
      UI is handled.
  - Comments in Workflow page,
    - Add appropriate icons for filters in workflow page.
    - Add indicators to show deletable Delivery Notes.
    - Add alternating stripes to the workflow page list.
  - Feature request in Create Invoice page,
    - Use Case: After the current financial year is roll closed, in the next year
      we need to be able to create an invoice for a purchase that took place in 
      the roll closed year. This is done by specifying the Invoice Date and Id that 
      was used by the seller in the previous year.
    - Need 2 extra fields to store the Supplier's Invoice No. and Date to achieve this.
    - Check https://margbooks.com to see how this is implemented
  - Comments in Login Page,
    - The label's that are not required are missing the red * and is causing an
      alignment mismatch with other labels that have one. Must level out this space
      to make all labels aligned.
    - The Demo account details title does not require an underline.
    - Follow the alignment pattern used in forms for demo account details card.
    - In production deployment, remove the demo account details in login page.
      For this maintain a variable in the server to distinguish between production
      and demo deployments.
    - Currently the password can be set the same as username, the password security
      check must not allow this.
    - Add "GnuKh@t@2021" as the placeholder for password field.
    - Make the password checks mandatory in production deployments.

Conclusion:

- Updates will be performed based on the points discussed above.

Agenda:

- Review past week's progress

Participants: GN, Karthik, Survesh

Updates:

- Karthik:

  - Separate url for creating & editing User, UOM and Godowns
  - Bug fixes for godown component

    Debit Credit Note, Rejection Note, Transfer Note. (Also updated
    gkcore to return note id after successful creation)

Points Discussed:

- Comments on Account form,

  - The row numbers are not required in Mobile view.
  - Rather than having the account list as a long table with data,
    display it as nested cards. Group -> Sub-Group -> Accounts

- Comments on having separate URL paths for create and edit of (User,
  UOM, Godowns),

  - Having separate URLs for create and edit operations is an objective
    approach and is a good practice to follow, even for similar cases
    throughout the app. (e.g. Accounts Forms)
  - This also allows for easily navigating to a certain point in the app
    with just the URL, and can also be shared easily with others.

- Discussion on plans for writing Unit Tests for gkcore (Test Driven
  Development approach). This will also make it easy to be released as a
  python package, as pip3 requires Unit Tests as part of its package
  requirements.
- The meeting ended with updating current progress in the gitlab
  progress tracking issue.

Conclusion:

- Updates will be performed based on the points discussed above.

- In Transaction form tables, index numbers are needed.
- Need more clarity on which godown the purchased products go to.

Conclusion:

  - Discuss with R2, Arun Kelkar and Abhijith about these questions.

- Suggestion to use the Organisation Image from DB in reports that are
  generated (Pdf, Printable screens, etc.)
- Discussions on the issues raised by R2 on the Product Register Report

  - (#129) Differentiating Between Invoice types is possible, currently
    not visible in demo deployment as no other type of Transactions are
    made.
  - (#128) To tackle having stocks of products in negative, its better
    to intimate users about low stock in Transaction forms. We will
    implement better validation and warning in the Transaction forms.

Conclusion:

  - Product Report
  - UI Updates to Side Bar
  - Password Verification Component
  - Login Page UI updates

- Survesh:

  - Date component Validation
  - Multiple Row support for Vouchers
  - Debit Credit Note Form
  - Switch between CGST/SGST & IGST in bill table

Points Discussed:

- Discussion on having login passwords optional for cases such as local
  deployment.

  - Since the password validation is not strictly enforced, weak
    passwords can be used in those cases.

- Discussion on creating an automated solutions to right align the form
  labels.
- In places with long lists of data, (like choosing an invoice in Debit
  Credit Note, etc), need a search widget with advanced filters to query
  and find the required data.

  - Later a SQL query API could be added, through which the frontend can
    query the DB in several ways.

- Comments on the bill table UI

  - The current pagination UI is not intuitive and requires an update.
  - The table requires two modes, (1) List items mode (2) Edit Mode
  - When clicking on an item from List Items mode, must move to the edit
    mode with selected item.

- Discussion on whether Debit Credit Note be created for a Customer or
  Supplier directly instead of an invoice.

  - In the case of customers or suppliers, vouchers are preferred than
    Debit Credit Notes.

- In Invoice table, CSGT/SGST and IGST must be chosen based on place of
  supply than using just the states of Organisation and Party.

  - This is because some invoices may not need a Customer Shipping
    Address, like in hotels serving food.
    [[https://www.gstfever.com/gst-on-hotel-restaurant-canteen-outdoor-catering/][(e.g.)]]

- Comments on Product report,

  - Text "Product Register" could be used instead of "Product Report"
    and "Document No." could be used instead of "Inv/Dr/Cr No."
  - Needs more filters to query the report list

- Discussion on need for a place to track where we are in the project.

  - Currently we track the progress API wise in gitlab (#55), this could
    be used to track even UI tasks.

Conclusion:

- The updates discussed this week are to be performed.
- The progress of the app and the tasks pending are to be tracked in the
  gitlab issue used for API progress (#55).

  :END:
Agenda:

- Review previous week's progress
- Discuss previous week points with R2

  1. The term used for Rejection Note (Rejection, Return or Cancel)
  2. Showing Tax fields and discount in Rejection Note Table
  3. Adding a boolean flag to UOM to note if its quantity is fractional
     or not.

Participants: GN, Karthik, R2, Survesh, VK

Updates:

- Abhijith:

  - Login credentials for Gnukhata.in

- Karthik:

  - Remembering last visited organisation (Login Page)

- Survesh:

  - Bill Table UI updates (vertical and horizontal modes)
  - Date component with different date format support

Points Discussed:

- Discussuion on the Bill Table updates:

  - The toggle option between vertical and horizontal modes can be
    avoided as it can be confusing and based on the screen size, one of
    the two modes may not be user friendly.
  - Use vertical mode as default for vertical mobile screens and
    horizontal mode for wider screen sizes.
  - Use Zoho's mobile app as a referrence to improve the vertical table
    layout.

- The date component requires a validation when a bad date is entered
  manually.
- Discussion on the Login page updates:

  - Can the last used user name be auto loaded, as its done for the
    company name and financial year? Currently not possible as it
    requires API support.
  - The form labels can be right aligned as in Transaction forms.

- Discussion on the need for different types of discounts:

  - Type 1: Discounts on things like pending payments to or from the
    organisation and the ability to add tax on them.
  - Type 2: Special Discounted rates for bulk purchase of items.

- Discussion on points from last week's meeting with R2:

  - (Point 1) R2 will get back on this
  - (Point 2) GST requires an invoice to be presented with its tax and
    discount
  - Currently we can achieve this manually with Debit Vouchers with
    multiple Cr and Dr rows. so the Rejection note table needs to
    display those fields as well.
  - (Point 3) Not dicussed in the meeting due to time constraints.

- Debit/Credit notes are supported by GST and Rejection note is not as
  its is used for internal purpose.

  - Thus find a way to combine rejection note within the Credit/Debit
    Note form, as its also done the same way in other accounting
    softwares (e.g. Zoho Books).

- Discussion on moving the domain gnukhata.in from its current provider
  to providers like gandhi.et

Conclusion:

- Perform the UI updates discussed in the meeting

  - Setting Table modes based on the screen sizes and updating its
    vertical view based on zoho mobile app.
  - Use right aligned form labels when they are horizontally alligned
    with the input field.
  - Find a way to combine Debit/Credit Note and Rejection Note

- Make a note of Discount features required in gkcore

  - Rejection Note form
  - UI updates in Bill and Total table, right alignment of form labels

Points Discussed:

    "Reject". (Discuss with R2)
  - Add checkboxes to reject all qty of a product.
  - Add quicker validation for Rejected Qty field, than on after
    pressing create button.

  - In the Bill table, explore the possibility of showing only Item,
    Qty, Rejected Qty columns. (Discuss with R2)
  - Must add provision for specifying a Rejection Fee.
  - The "Create New Product" Button must not be visible in the Bill
    Table.

- Comments on Bill Table component:

  - Update: IGST, CESS, VAT fields are hidden in mobile view. Comments:
    Columns must not be hidden completely, Use a collapsable table here
    so that the full table data is always there.
  - Use a vertical table layout to tackle the above mentioned issue. Add
    traversable buttons here to navigate between the multiple rows.
  - In vertical table layout, the amounts must be right aligned.
    (currently left aligned)
  - The Qty field, must be aware if the product can be fractional in
    quantity or not. Add an extra field in create UOM form, to store
    this data. (Discuss with R2)

- In Total Table component, the roundoff radio button currently doesn't
  have a label stating its purpose. Convert this into a labelled switch
  or button.

Participants: Karthik, R2, Survesh, VK

Updates:

- Karthik:

  - Cost center component (CRUD)
  - Docker compose for gkcore and gwebapp
  - Added Build instruction wiki for gkcore & gkwebapp

Points Discussed:

- Moving to Docker compose from docker has normal writing normal docker
  files has reduced the docker container size by 200MB.
- Abhijith has given access to DockerHub Account for GNUkhata
- Discussions on UOM list,

  - There is a list of 38 government approved UOM items that has to be
    used for GST.
  - Currently used accounting softwares allow the creation of custom,
    non standard UOM units for internal usage. These can later be mapped
    to standardized UOM units when used in a GST setting.
  - We need to have a provision that says the created UOM unit is either
    a standard one or is mapped to a standard one or not. Also this can
    be color coded for ease of use. Green - Standard Unit, Amber -
    Mapped to Standard Unit, Red - Not Mapped to Standard Unit
  - Also we can't use only the GST standard UOM units at all times, as
    there might be organisations that don't fall under GST regulations.

- Discussion on keeping the app from being hardcoded into a India
  specific accounting package.

Conclusion:

- Add the provision to store the status of a UOM unit, whether if it was
  standard or if it was mapped to a standard one.

- Discussion on the name of Cost Center,

  - Cost center or Cost accounting is used with the aim of reducing
    cost.
  - Profit center or Profit accounting is used with the aim of improving
    profits.
  - So the term Cost center should be used.

- In Edit Godown form, the confirmation box needs to include more
  information.

Agenda:

- Review previous week's progress

Updates:

- Karthik:

  - Replacing Nginx Server with Caddy
  - Godown form (Listing)

- Survesh:

  - Deconstruction of Invoice form into individual components
  - Delivery Note and Cash Memo Form UI

Points Discussed:

- Why replace Nginx with Caddy

  - Auto renewal of SSL
  - Uses and manages LetsEncrypt certificate, given a valid domain name

- Caddy has an issue, where the static assets are served via http

  - Possible solution: make waitress listen from port 443

- Discussions about Docker Container,

  - Use of single parent directory must be preferred for Docker
    Containers, instead of different unique ones.
  - This helps keeping track of different container data.
  - Since Docker Containers are volatile in nature, data requiring
    persistence must be stored in the disk.

- Comments on Delivery Note form,

  - In total Table, the rupee symbol takes up one extra line, make
    adjustments to keep both rupee symbol and the price in same line.
  - In Bill Table, the Item input field is smaller than other input
    fields. Make its dimensions equal as the others.

- Update from Abhijith, the Social handles of GNUKhata are managed by an
  HR from Accion (Rachita Jha).

Conclusion:

- Try making waitress listen from port 443 to fix the issue with Caddy.
- Use single parent directory for the Docker containers created.
- Store data that requires persistence in disk and not in Docker
  container.
- Perform the UI updates discussed.

- Comments on Delivery Chalan form:

  - The card close and open icons are very similar and can be changed to
    something easy and unique. Possibly even color coded.
  - It would be nice if the heading of the cards are configurable.

- Since side panes are a staple in desktop apps, The navigation options
  can be moved from the top bar to the side nav bar.
- Discussion about the Dev server hosting and practices to be followed:

  - The process used in hosting the server can be blogged explaining why
    and how to perform the same.
  - In a conversation into industry best practices for deployment of
    servers, using Docker was decided to be a good choice, given its
    ease of use and accessiblity by people from different walks of life
    within the tech industry.
  - Using Docker Compose should be preferred than to writing the Docker
    files from scratch. Alternatives like Ansible could be explored.
  - Currently the Docker Compose written will support NGINX as the
    default load balancer than Apache.

- Conversation about future plans:

  - Explore Ways to package GNUKhata's gkapp with tech like snaps,
    flatpaks or appimages.
  - gkcore (Docker) & gkapp (snap/flatpak/appimage)
  - Releasing a Debian package of GNUKhata in the future.
  - Once the UI is done and is distribution ready, Unit Tests have to be
    written for gkcore.
  - Possibly rewrite gkcore without a hard dependency on RDBMS and move
    to Flat File model, so as to support easy encryption and better
    portability.

Conclusion:

- Docker will be used for packaging and deploying gkcore.
- Docker Compose will be used to configure Docker and Nginx for our
  needs.
- Options to package gkapp, like snap-flatpak-appimage should be
  explored.
- Implementation of the side navigation pane.

    counterpart in invoice) state and the states involved in the invoice
    are different.
  - It must be CGST(9%) and SGST (9%) when the Organisation's state and
    the states involved in the invoice are same.

- Topic 2

  - Server requirements for the GNUKhata dev setup is minimal and since
    it is only for dev purpose not for public consumption, we can go
    with the starting tier.
  - After the dev server is hosted and is running, after a few weeks,
    Discourse could be hosted on a separate instance with the required
    minimum specs.
  - Slowly tranisiton from Telegram to Discourse for community
    interaction and use Telegram internally for discussions among team.

  Company/Organisation.
- Discussion on making Date Format, Naming convention for
  Company/Organisaiton as configurable elements.
- (Topic 3) Discussion on displaying the Product Quantity along side its

  - Products that are empty can be avoided while billing.
  - Products with very low inventory can be intimated to the admin for
    restocking

- (Topic 4) Discussion on a customer or supplier (say Godrej) having
  only one GSTIN mapped to them and creating separate
  customers/suppliers (say Godrej_Punjab or Godrej_Delhi) to add GSTIN
  for them in other states.

  - R2 suggests that this approach is widely used and would also help
    while going through the reports.
  - The ability to group these sub Customers under a main Customer could
    also be useful.

Conclusion:

    the User Name is used for both.
  - Can use a verifiable email id as User login id, the verification
    part can be implemented later on, a verified flag would be nice to
    have now.
  - User name should not be displayed twice, possibly try out a
    searchable card based UI

- Discussion about Logs of events happening that admin can view:

  - It would be nice to have a notification or intimation when a new log
    has been registered.
  - Currently logs in gkcore, do not record the proper timestamp. (BUG)

- Discussion about Deleting User

  - Transactions are recorded without dependency on the User table, so
    on the event of a user being deleted transactions created by them
    won't be affected.
  - Also currently GKCore allows for the deletion of the last remaining
    user, creating an unusable state. (BUG) (Decided to make a temporary
    fix on client side, to prevent this)

- In Voucher forms, there must be an option for creating multiple Dr/ Cr
  rows
- Remember the Indian state selected in the forms in local storage, so
  that it will be usefull the next time, if the same state is required
  (Which usually is).

  - Number fields in the forms change when scrolled over them (Firefox)
  - Stocks involved in Transactions are deletable, this could cause
    integrity issues
  - Could have the option to denote if an Invoice is independent of Tax
  - Need for Global config where if only GST is opted, UI options for
    VAT doesn't appear anywhere in the app.

    matrix
  - Focusing on supporting through one forum than many, as it will be
    easy to manage in the long run

- The difference between "Opening Stock" field in the Product Details
  page and the "Stock" that gets created with transactions like Buy &
  Sell
- Having GNUKhata as a full feature package instead of splitting it into
  3 variations (Accounts, Accounts + Invoicing, Account + Invoicing +
  Inventory)
- Comments on Workflow page:

  - List the workflow page items such as "Customers" and "Products",
    like a list of scrollable cards

    - (Like in a chat app like telegram)

  - The order of this list of cards should be filterable (by properties
    like date, alphabet, etc.)
  - Add 2 new Workflow items

    - Transactions
    - Reports

  - Club Workflow items

    - Customer/Supplier into "Contacts"
    - Products/Services into "Goods & Services"

  - Add a field to choose between the clubbed items, in their respective
    forms

Conclusion:

- Find out about the various support forums for GNUKhata
- Update the Workflow page UI based on the comments from Points
  Discussed

Agenda:

- Product / Service forms in workflow page
- UI framework with Accessibility support

Points Discussed:

- Comments on Product / Service forms:

  - The different panes in the forms, like price, stock, tax, could be
    distinguished by colours.

    - As they currently merge with the background and make it hard to
      distinguish hierarchy

  - Input fields could be colour coded based on their type.

    - e.g. money fields could be coloured saffron through out the app,
      and so on

  - Reduce white spacing in the forms and app, where possible so as to
    make the UI compact.

    - e.g. In form, the field title and input area could be placed on
      the same line, instead of two

  - Remove redundant text and contextually understandable text in form.

    - e.g. Create Organisation Name -> Organisation
    - Organisation Name -> Name, Organisation Type -> Type, Admin Name
      -> Admin

  - Doubts:

    - Does GST have to be recorded in two parts (State and Central)?
    - Is VAT still required, since we are using GST?
    - Is GST calculatable from HSN code?

- Comments on UI framework with Accessibility support:

  - The Bootstrap-Vue demo made to replicate the existing UI flows, got
    good accessibility scores in Chromium lighthouse.
  - Since the accessibility support was built in and had better
    documentation on how to add the same, was easier to implement.
  - Thus Based on the output of this demo, decision was made to port the
    existing UI flows to Bootstrap-Vue and continue from there

Conclusion:

- Migrate from Buefy to Bootstrap-Vue
- Incorporate comments on UI enhancement (White spaces, Redundant text,
  Distinguishing with Colour codes)

Agenda:

- Review last week's task list

Points Discussed:

- Accessibility aspect of gnukhata: Research with accessibility rich
  frameworks

  - Create a demo with the accessible rich framework
  - Compare the demo with the existing setup in terms of ease of adding
    accessibility, size of final output, etc.

- Question: How are service providers handled in GNUkhata? Does it take
  in account the time taken to provide a service?
- Bring Customer, Supplier, Product, Service, Invoice and Report
  profiles under a single page called Workflows
- Ask a company their GNUKhata accounting data for research and
  understanding purposes
- Milestone Basic: January 15th

  - Workflow Page: Customer, Supplier, Product, Service, Invoice, Report
    profiles
  - User Page: Create, list users

- Discuss and change how the current forms look, to make it more easy to
  use

  - e.g. In the Create Customer Form,

    - Pincode could be taken directly from the address input field
    - State could be selected from the Pincode, rather than entering
      manually

- Data privacy: Hide sensitive client data by masking them from users
  without proper privileges

Conclusion:

- Add product/service tab
- Explore alternative frameworks which prioritize accessibility
- Obtain real data on financial year of a company for better
  understanding of inventory & accounting

Agenda:

- Discuss about versioning scheme for gkapp
- User stories

Points Discussed:

- Make sure the webapp is Screen reader compliant and follows the
  general accessibility standards
- Webapp must be ready for localization, possibly reuse existing
  localization resources (Malayalam, Marathi, Hindi, English)
- For forms, make the first field selected by default, to make it more
  accessible
- User Story Comments

  - The current User stories have been written using the existing
    software as base
  - The User stories have to be created by talking with and taking
    feedback from actual people with accounting needs from various
    backgrounds
  - For example the budgeting needs of an Non profit, may require some
    custom fields that the software must have provision to create
  - Use cases like the above example should also be thought of and
    addressed
  - Better UI flows like Usage based UI design patterns could also be
    brought in to make the UI flow easier

- Make the most used pages in the web app more user friendly, like the
  Invoice creation page, Customer/Seller page, Product/Service page
- For the Customer/Seller page, Product/Service page, use UI like in
  chat apps
- For example if you take a Customer page, all the customers will be
  listed, and on clicking on the customer, the transactions with that
  customer will be listed. Also the list of customers could be sorted
  based on filters, a particular customer must be searchable using a
  search bar.

Conclusion:

1. Creating Customers, Sellers
2. Localization
3. Screen reader support
