      <h3>Tally & GNUKhata (.xlsx)</h3>
      <p>
        This section will assist you to import data from any software that
        exports data to XLSX spreadsheets.Such software includes Tally ERP 9
        (and GNUKhata itself), which exports list of accounts and vouchers in
        two separate spreadsheet. Note however that a spreadsheet containing
        data exported from GNUKhata precisely contains list of accounts and
        vouchers in two separate sheets. However if the proper specifications
        are followed, you can get data from other programs too. As an example,
        all you need is to export data from Tally to a spreadsheet in xlsx
        format. This can be done by following instructions given below.

        <li>
          In case of a credit opening balance the amount goes in the third
          column[column C].
